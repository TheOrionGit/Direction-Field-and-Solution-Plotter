Hello! Thanks for using my program! \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program is designed for plotting the phase plane of a two dimensional autonomous system of first order differential equations.
It only supports basic arithmetic functions (+, -, * , /, **) and some trig functions (sin, cos, tan).
All operations must be explicit (sin(y) * (1-5*x) not siny(1-5x)). 
Functionality is not guarenteed for the solutions of a phase plane including tan() given their asymptotic behavior.
For now the Test Solutions checkbox is nonfunctional, so click it all you like. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my first time making an app or using GitHub, and I made it in 12 hours, so forgive the lack of optimization, features, or proper documentation/legible code.
Not sure how often or if I will update or fix anything, as it has served the purpose it was created for and was functional enough.
Nevertheless, I am eager to review and probably implement any pull requests and will give some attention to any issues that are pointed out, especially if they suggest a direction to go in terms of fixing them.
